Thank you for downloading and using this app I created. Set up and all functionality of the app will be listed and described below. If you have any questions or suggestions for future releases you may DM me on twitter @DSkid48.

[Set up]
*You must have Java installed for the application to work. The first step is verifying that you have Java*
*Open up commands prompt by pressing the Windows key. Type "cmd" then hit enter. Type in "java -version" If it says "command java unknown" then you need to install Java before running the application*
*I made this app on JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 1.8_171 if you have an older version than this your milage my varry. I recommend updating to at least that Java version*
*Once you have Java you may install the app*

1. Move application to its own folder. Though it is not technically required, giving the application its own folder will help you keep track of the text files it generates.
2. Double-click the application to generate the two text files.
3. Open OBS.
4. Select new source, and scroll down to TEXT(GDI+). Make sure to tick the box that says Read from file. Navigate to the application folder. Click the file named "Record.txt" and then click open.
